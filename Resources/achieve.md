# The ACHIEVE Framework

We should approach AI with a focus on augmented, not artificial, intelligence. Augmented intelligence is about using AI to enhance human abilities rather than replace people. The goal is to create an "exoskeleton for the mind" - tools that amplify our creativity, productivity, and problem-solving skills.

Augmented intelligence keeps humans firmly in the loop. It provides aid and assistance but relies on human guidance, oversight, and improvement. This ensures people remain integral to the process rather than being automated away. Augmented intelligence combines the strengths of humans and machines to help us think more critically, get outside our biases, inspire new solutions, and accomplish great things we couldn't on our own. It expands what is humanly possible. This collaborative approach recognizes that there are unique capabilities possessed by both humans and AI. The key is utilizing AI in a way that augments and complements our distinctly human skills and spark.

The ACHIEVE framework provides an approach to using Generative AI in a way that augments human intelligence rather than replaces people. The goal is to enhance creativity, productivity, and problem-solving by combining the strengths of humans and AI.

## Key Aspects of the ACHIEVE Framework

- **Aiding human coordination**: Use AI to help teams coordinate better by summarizing discussions, clarifying ambiguities in plans, and identifying potential conflicts.
  
- **Cutting out tedious tasks**: Automate repetitive and mundane work so people can focus their time on more meaningful and engaging activities.
  
- **Helping provide a safety net**: Have AI review work products to catch mistakes and errors a human could miss.
  
- **Inspiring better problem solving and creativity**: Interact with the AI output to stimulate new ideas and critical thinking. Treat it as a starting point, not the final product.
  
- **Enabling great ideas to scale faster**: Use generative capabilities to rapidly prototype and expand on creative concepts in ways not humanly feasible.

## ACHIEVE Acronym

- **A**: Aiding human coordination
- **C**: Cutting out tedious tasks
- **H**: Helping provide a safety net
- **IEV**: Inspiring better problem solving and creativity
- **E**: Enabling great ideas to scale faster

Adopting this augmented intelligence mindset ensures humans remain integral to the process rather than being automated away. The key is leveraging AI's capabilities while still valuing, guiding, and improving upon its work. Used appropriately in this manner, generative AI can transform what individuals and organizations can accomplish.
