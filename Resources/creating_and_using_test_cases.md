# Creating and Using Test Cases to Identify Errors in LLM Responses

This lesson explores the importance of using test cases to verify the accuracy and reliability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. By creating scenarios where the correct answers are known in advance, we can effectively spot errors and build confidence in the model's performance.

## Key Takeaways

### Importance of Test Cases

1. **Ensuring Accuracy**:
   - Creating test cases where the answers are known beforehand allows for a straightforward way to check if the LLM is producing correct results. This is crucial for ensuring that the model is not hallucinating or generating incorrect information.
   - When you work with code interpreters or LLMs, you can introduce a document, question, or any data where the expected outcome is already determined. By comparing the model's output to the known answer, you can verify its accuracy.

2. **Building Confidence**:
   - Regularly testing the model with known outcomes helps build trust in its capabilities. This practice not only ensures that the model is functioning correctly but also boosts your confidence in its outputs.
   - Through consistent and repetitive testing, you can identify any recurring issues or patterns of error, which can then be addressed to improve the model's performance.

### Creating Synthetic Data

1. **Generating Realistic Test Cases**:
   - Creating synthetic data that mimics real data is an effective strategy for testing. This approach allows you to generate numerous test cases without risking the exposure of sensitive or private information.
   - For instance, you can create a fake car rental receipt that looks realistic. This synthetic receipt can then be used to test the LLM's ability to analyze and interpret the data accurately.

2. **Flexibility in Testing**:
   - Synthetic data allows for flexibility in generating various scenarios and edge cases. You can design data that intentionally violates certain rules or policies to see if the LLM correctly identifies these violations.
   - This method is particularly useful in environments where using actual data might not be feasible due to privacy concerns or legal restrictions.

### Testing Policy Compliance

1. **Negative and Positive Test Cases**:
   - Developing both negative test cases (which intentionally violate rules) and positive test cases (which comply with all rules) provides a comprehensive way to test the LLM's reasoning and accuracy.
   - For example, you can generate a receipt that includes a type of insurance that should not be reimbursed according to a specific policy. This tests whether the LLM can accurately identify and reason about the policy rules.

2. **Analyzing Results**:
   - By examining the LLM's analysis of these test cases, you can determine its effectiveness in applying the correct rules and identifying discrepancies. This analysis helps ensure that the model's reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes.
   - Detailed examination of the LLM's output against the known test cases can highlight areas where the model may be prone to errors or hallucinations, providing insights for further refinement.

### Practical Application

1. **Using Public Policies with Synthetic Data**:
   - Combining public documents, such as a university's travel expense policy, with synthetic data, like fake travel receipts, allows for thorough testing without compromising sensitive information.
   - This approach helps simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment, making it easier to test the model's compliance and reasoning capabilities.

2. **Initial Summarization and Continuous Testing**:
   - Starting with the summarization of a policy document and then introducing various test cases can provide a structured way to test the LLM's performance. This method ensures that the model understands the policy before being tested with different scenarios.
   - Continuous testing with multiple iterations and variations of test cases helps maintain the accuracy and reliability of the LLM over time. It ensures that the model adapts and remains consistent in its outputs.

### Conclusion

Using test cases is a powerful method to verify the accuracy and consistency of LLM responses. By generating both synthetic and real data with known outcomes, you can identify potential errors, build confidence in the model's performance, and ensure that the LLM's reasoning aligns with the expected results. This practice is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the information generated by large language models.
