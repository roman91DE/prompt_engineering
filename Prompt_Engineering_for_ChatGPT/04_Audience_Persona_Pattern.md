# Using Contextual Statements in Prompts

When crafting prompts for effective communication and understanding, it's essential to provide fundamental contextual statements. This approach ensures that the explanation is tailored to the audience's background, making complex topics more accessible. The pattern involves specifying both the subject matter (X) and the persona (Y) to whom the explanation is directed.

## Fundamental Contextual Statements

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

1. **Explain X to me.**

2. **Assume that I am Persona Y.**

### How to Use the Pattern

1. **Identify the Topic (X)**: Determine the subject matter you want to be explained.
2. **Select an Appropriate Persona (Y)**: Choose a persona that represents the assumed background knowledge of the audience. This could be someone with limited knowledge in a specific field or an expert in another.

### Examples

Below are examples demonstrating the use of this pattern:

- **Example 1:**
    - **Prompt:** Explain large language models to me. Assume that I am a bird.
    - **Explanation:** In this case, the topic is "large language models," and the persona is a "bird." The explanation should be simplified and perhaps use analogies that a bird (as a metaphor for someone with no background in computer science) might understand.

- **Example 2:**
    - **Prompt:** Explain how the supply chains for US grocery stores work to me. Assume that I am Genghis Khan.
    - **Explanation:** Here, the topic is "the supply chains for US grocery stores," and the persona is "Genghis Khan." The explanation should consider the historical context and limited knowledge of modern logistics that Genghis Khan might have, using relevant comparisons from his era.

### Creating Effective Prompts

When creating your prompts, ensure clarity and specificity. Clearly define the topic and thoughtfully choose a persona that helps shape the explanation in a meaningful way.

By following this pattern, you can generate explanations that are not only informative but also engaging and accessible to diverse audiences.
