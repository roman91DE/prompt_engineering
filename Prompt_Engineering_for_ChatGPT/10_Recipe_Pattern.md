# Recipe Prompt Pattern for LLMs

The recipe prompt pattern is a structured approach to guiding language models (LLMs) in generating detailed and sequential instructions to achieve a specified goal. This pattern leverages the clarity of specifying known steps and asking the model to fill in gaps, ensuring comprehensive and practical outputs.

## Benefits

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Provides a clear framework for the LLM, resulting in more organized and coherent responses.
2. **Completeness**: Encourages the model to generate all necessary steps, reducing the likelihood of missed details.
3. **Customization**: Allows for tailoring the steps based on known requirements, making the output more relevant and practical.
4. **Efficiency**: Helps in breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, facilitating easier execution.

## Use Cases

1. **Project Planning**: Outlining steps for complex projects, ensuring all aspects are covered.
2. **Learning Paths**: Creating detailed learning plans for acquiring new skills or knowledge.
3. **Travel Planning**: Organizing trips with specific preferences and constraints.
4. **Process Improvement**: Analyzing and optimizing business or personal workflows by identifying and removing unnecessary steps.

## Template

```
I would like to achieve X.

I know that I need to perform steps A, B, C.

Provide a complete sequence of steps for me.

Fill in any missing steps.

(Optional) Identify any unnecessary steps.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Purchasing a House

```
I would like to purchase a house.

I know that I need to perform steps make an offer and close on the house.

Provide a complete sequence of steps for me.

Fill in any missing steps.
```

### Example 2: Driving to NYC from Nashville

```
I would like to drive to NYC from Nashville.

I know that I want to go through Asheville, NC on the way and that I don't want to drive more than 300 miles per day.

Provide a complete sequence of steps for me.

Fill in any missing steps.
```

### Example 3: Learning Python Programming

```
I would like to learn Python programming.

I know that I need to perform steps learn syntax basics, practice with small projects, and study advanced topics.

Provide a complete sequence of steps for me.

Fill in any missing steps.

(Optional) Identify any unnecessary steps.
```

### Example 4: Organizing a Conference

```
I would like to organize a professional conference.

I know that I need to perform steps secure a venue, invite speakers, and promote the event.

Provide a complete sequence of steps for me.

Fill in any missing steps.

(Optional) Identify any unnecessary steps.
```

By following this structured approach, users can harness the power of LLMs to generate detailed and actionable plans for a wide range of tasks, ensuring nothing is overlooked and optimizing the overall process.
