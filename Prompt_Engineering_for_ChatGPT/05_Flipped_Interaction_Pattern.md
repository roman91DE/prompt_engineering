# Using Contextual Statements in Prompts for Effective Questioning

When you need assistance in achieving a specific goal through a series of questions, it is important to structure your prompt clearly. This approach ensures that the process is focused, efficient, and productive. The pattern involves specifying both the objective (X) and the condition (Y) under which questioning should stop. 

## Fundamental Contextual Statements

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

1. **I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X.**

2. **You should ask questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this goal (alternatively, forever).**

3. *(Optional)* **Specify how the questions should be asked:** one at a time, two at a time, ask the first question, etc.

### How to Use the Pattern

1. **Identify the Goal (X)**: Determine the specific objective you want to achieve through the questioning.
2. **Define the Stopping Condition (Y)**: Specify when the questioning should stop, based on achieving sufficient information or a specific goal.
3. **Decide on the Questioning Format** (Optional): Choose how you prefer the questions to be asked, whether one at a time, in pairs, or starting with a specific question.

### Examples

Below are examples demonstrating the use of this pattern:

- **Example 1:**
    - **Prompt:** I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials. You should ask questions until you have sufficient information about my current draft messages, audience, and goals. Ask me the first question.
    - **Explanation:** In this case, the goal is to create variations of marketing materials, and the condition is having sufficient information about draft messages, audience, and goals. The questioning starts with the first question.

- **Example 2:**
    - **Prompt:** I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.
    - **Explanation:** Here, the goal is diagnosing an Internet problem, and the condition is identifying the two most likely causes. The questions are asked one at a time, starting with the first question.

### Creating Effective Prompts

When creating your prompts, ensure clarity and specificity. Clearly define the goal and thoughtfully choose a stopping condition that helps achieve the desired outcome in a meaningful way.

By following this pattern, you can engage in a structured questioning process that is not only effective but also tailored to achieving your specific objectives.

# Explanation of Python Programming for a Dog

## Introduction
Imagine that Python programming is like playing fetch with your human. It involves commands, actions, and results, just like how you interact with your human.

## Commands
In Python, commands are called "code." Just like when your human says "sit" or "stay," these commands tell the computer what to do. 

## Actions
When you hear "fetch," you run and get the ball. In Python, when the computer hears a command, it performs an action. For example, a command might tell the computer to add two numbers or display a message.

## Results
When you bring the ball back, your human is happy, and you might get a treat. In Python, when the computer completes an action, it produces a result. This could be a number, a word, or something shown on the screen.

## Example
Imagine if fetching a ball was written in Python code:

```python
def fetch_ball():
    print("Run and get the ball")
    print("Bring it back to the human")
    print("Get a treat")

fetch_ball()
```

In this code:
- `def fetch_ball():` is like the command "fetch" that tells you to get the ball.
- `print("Run and get the ball")` is the action of running to get the ball.
- `print("Bring it back to the human")` is the action of returning the ball.
- `print("Get a treat")` is the result of getting a treat from your human.

## Conclusion
Python programming is all about giving commands (like "fetch"), performing actions (running to get the ball), and seeing the results (getting a treat). Just like you learn tricks from your human, computers learn to do tasks through programming!
