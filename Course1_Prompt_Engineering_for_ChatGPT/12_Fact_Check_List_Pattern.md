# Fact Check List Prompt Pattern

## Introduction
The fact check list prompt pattern is a structured approach to ensure the accuracy and reliability of any text output. By including a set of fundamental facts at the end of the output, this pattern helps identify and verify the key pieces of information that support the veracity of the entire text.

## Template

Whenever you output text, generate a set of facts that are contained in the output. The set of facts should be inserted at the end of the output. The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect.

## Example

### Output Text
Climate change is a significant global issue driven by human activities such as deforestation, fossil fuel consumption, and industrial processes. The rise in global temperatures has led to the melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. Immediate actions, including the reduction of carbon emissions and the adoption of renewable energy sources, are essential to mitigate these effects.

### Fact List
1. Climate change is driven by human activities such as deforestation, fossil fuel consumption, and industrial processes.

3. Rising sea levels are a consequence of climate change.
4. More frequent extreme weather events are linked to climate change.
5. Reduction of carbon emissions is necessary to mitigate climate change.
6. Adoption of renewable energy sources is essential to combat climate change.

## Conclusion
Using the fact check list prompt pattern helps ensure that the critical facts supporting any text output are clear and verifiable. This method not only aids in maintaining the accuracy of the information but also provides a concise summary of the key points that are crucial for the integrity of the text.
