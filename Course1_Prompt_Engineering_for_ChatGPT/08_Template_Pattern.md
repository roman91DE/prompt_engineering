# Template Pattern in Prompt Engineering

## Overview
The Template Pattern in prompt engineering is a method used to create structured and formatted outputs using Language Learning Models (LLMs). This pattern ensures that the generated output adheres to a specified template, preserving the format and structure defined by the user.

## Fundamental Contextual Statements
To use the Template Pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
1. **Template Provision**: "I am going to provide a template for your output."
2. **Placeholder Definition**: "X is my placeholder for content."
3. **Placeholder Utilization**: "Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list."
4. **Format Preservation**: "Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide."

## Benefits of the Template Pattern
- **Consistency**: Ensures the generated text adheres to a specific format, improving readability and usability.
- **Control**: Allows users to define the structure of the output, making it easier to integrate into existing workflows.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for post-processing, as the output is already in the desired format.

## Use Cases
- **Document Generation**: Creating formatted reports, emails, or other documents.
- **Data Presentation**: Structuring data outputs for easy interpretation and analysis.
- **Instructional Content**: Generating step-by-step guides or instructional material.
- **API Responses**: Ensuring consistent response formats for API outputs.

## Example: Python Function Declaration

### Prompt
"I am going to provide a template for your output. `<placeholder>` is my placeholder for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. 

This is the template: 

```python
def FUNCTION_NAME(PARAMETERS):
    \"\"\"Function to DESCRIPTION\"\"\"
    IMPLEMENTATION
    return RETURN_VALUE
```

### Example Output
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    \"\"\"Function to add two numbers\"\"\"
    result = a + b
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Example
In this example, the template provided specifies the structure of a Python function. The placeholders are:
- `FUNCTION_NAME`: The name of the function.
- `PARAMETERS`: The parameters of the function.
- `DESCRIPTION`: A brief description of what the function does.
- `IMPLEMENTATION`: The code block that implements the function.
- `RETURN_VALUE`: The value that the function returns.

The generated output replaces these placeholders with appropriate content, resulting in a properly formatted Python function.

## Conclusion
The Template Pattern in prompt engineering is a powerful tool for creating structured and formatted outputs with LLMs. By providing a clear template and defining placeholders, users can ensure consistency, control, and efficiency in their generated content.
