# Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Few-Shot Prompting

### Concept
Few-shot prompting involves providing the model with a few examples (shots) of the desired task within the prompt. This technique leverages the model's ability to generalize from limited examples to perform new tasks. Few-shot prompting is especially useful when labeled data is scarce or when quick prototyping of model behavior is needed.

### Benefits
- **Flexibility:** Can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal adjustments.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Allows quick testing of model capabilities on new tasks.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Sentiment Analysis
**Prompt:**
```
Review: "I love this product! It works perfectly and exceeds my expectations."
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "The item arrived late and was damaged. Very disappointed."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "The service was okay, but the food was great."
Sentiment:
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Positive
```

#### Example 2: Language Translation
**Prompt:**
```
Translate English to French:

English: "Hello, how are you?"
French: "Bonjour, comment ça va?"

English: "What is your name?"
French: "Comment tu t'appelles?"

English: "I would like to order a coffee."
French:
```
**Expected Output:**
```
"Je voudrais commander un café."
```

## Chain of Thought Prompting

### Concept
Chain of thought prompting involves guiding the model through the reasoning process step-by-step. This method is particularly useful for complex tasks requiring logical reasoning, calculations, or multi-step decision-making. By breaking down the problem, the model can produce more accurate and coherent responses.

### Benefits
- **Improved Reasoning:** Enhances the model's ability to handle complex queries.
- **Transparency:** Provides insights into the model's thought process.
- **Accuracy:** Increases the likelihood of correct and reliable outputs.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Mathematical Problem Solving
**Prompt:**
```
Problem: "If a train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it travel?"
Solution:
1. Calculate the distance by multiplying the speed by the time.
2. Distance = Speed × Time
3. Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours
4. Distance = 
```
**Expected Output:**
```
180 miles
```

#### Example 2: Logical Reasoning
**Prompt:**
```
Question: "Alice, Bob, and Carol are sitting in a row. Alice is not sitting next to Bob. Who is sitting in the middle?"
Solution:
1. List possible seating arrangements: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.
2. Eliminate arrangements where Alice is next to Bob: ABC, BAC, BCA, CBA.
3. Remaining arrangements: ACB, CAB.
4. In ACB, Carol is in the middle.
5. In CAB, Alice is in the middle.
6. The seating arrangement where Alice is not next to Bob is ACB.
7. Therefore, the person sitting in the middle is
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Carol
```

## ReAct Prompting

### Concept
ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting combines reasoning with actions that the model should take based on its reasoning. This method is effective for tasks that require interaction with external systems, iterative decision-making, or dynamic task execution.

### Benefits
- **Dynamic Interactions:** Enables models to interact with external systems or APIs.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Supports step-by-step refinement of outputs.
- **Complex Task Handling:** Suitable for tasks requiring both logical reasoning and actions.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Web Search Interaction
**Prompt:**
```
Task: "Find the latest news about climate change."
1. Reason: To find the latest news, we need to perform a web search.
2. Action: Perform a web search for "latest news about climate change."
3. Reason: Analyze the top results to identify relevant news articles.
4. Action: Summarize the key points from the top 3 articles.
5. Summary:
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1. Article 1: Recent studies show a significant increase in global temperatures.
2. Article 2: New policies are being implemented to reduce carbon emissions.
3. Article 3: Climate change impacts on wildlife are becoming more severe.
```

#### Example 2: API Interaction for Weather Information
**Prompt:**
```
Task: "Get the current weather in New York City."
1. Reason: To get the current weather, we need to call a weather API.
2. Action: Call the weather API with the query "current weather in New York City."
3. Reason: Parse the API response to extract the temperature and conditions.
4. Action: Format the extracted information for user-friendly output.
5. Weather Information:
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Temperature: 75°F
Conditions: Partly cloudy
```

## Conclusion
Each prompting method—few-shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and ReAct prompting—offers unique advantages tailored to different types of tasks. By understanding and applying these techniques, prompt engineers can effectively leverage the capabilities of large language models to solve a diverse array of problems.
